## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Ans:
1. Maintains customer satisfaction and trust. Enhances reputation and credibility. Reduces project costs and resource waste.
2. Project managers can met deadline by using the agile methodology or waterfall methodology.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

it helps to acheive the project on time and meet the quality assurance and quality control.
Estimate costs for resources, materials, and equipment.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile:
Iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer
feedback.
Advantages:
- Quick response to changes.
- Regular customer feedback.
- Improved team collaboration.
Disadvantages:
- Less predictability.
- Requires significant customer involvement.

Waterfall:
Linear and sequential approach. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Advantages:
- Clear structure and documentation.
- Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
Disadvantages:
- Difficult to accommodate changes.
- Testing occurs late in the process.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile
1. Mobile app development with frequent updates.
2. E-commerce platform development with changing business requirements.
3. Artificial intelligence or machine learning projects.

Waterfall:
1. Building construction or bridge development.
2. Embedded systems development (e.g., firmware).

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
- Process-oriented approach.
